# Problem Solving
## UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
### Step 1. Create function that randomly generates rock, paper, or scissor
-Randomly selecting from an array of 3 [r,p,s] so [0,1,2]
-Using math.random with math.floor and 3 as the max.

### Step 2. Create function to play a round of the game
-Include attributes (player and computer selection) for the function
-Making the player selection case insensitive
-Return a string with the winner

### Step 3. Create function to play a game of 5 rounds
-Create a for loop that stops after 5 rounds
-Keep score after each round
-After 5 rounds, return the result of the game

## PLAN
### Step 1. Create function that randomly generates rock, paper, or scissor
-Using math.random with math.floor and 3 as the max.

### Step 2. Create function to play a round of the game
-Use conditional statement to make player selection case insensitive
-Use conditional statement to decide the winner
-Use return to return the result

### Step 3. Create function to play a game of 5 rounds
-Declare a variable for player score and one for computer score that start at 0
-Create a for loop that stops after 5 rounds by declaring an i variable
-After each round add the score to the score variables
-When i equals 5 return the result using a conditional statement (if player score is higher than computer score then "you win", if the scores are the same, then "you tie", otherwise "you lose")
